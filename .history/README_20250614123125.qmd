# FHIR to XML Mapping System

This project is a modular PHP middleware that maps FHIR-formatted JSON data into CollaborateMD-compatible XML payloads. It is designed for high configurability and control, particularly for professional healthcare claims.

## 🔧 Features

- Dynamic field extraction using JSON mapping files
- Native PHP XML generation with `DOMDocument`
- Modular mappers per FHIR resource (Patient, Practitioner, Coverage, etc.)
- Supports both single-resource and FHIR Bundle inputs
- Easily extensible and testable structure

## 🗂 Directory Structure

```
src/
├── Mapping/
│   ├── MapperInterface.php
│   ├── BaseMapper.php         # (shared extractValue logic)
│   ├── PatientMapper.php
│   ├── ClaimMapper.php
│   ├── ...
vendor/                        # Composer dependencies
public/
├── index.php                 # Entry point and test runner
FHIR-*.json                   # Input resource examples
*.json                        # Field mapping config files
```

## ▶️ Running the Script

You can run the program using the PHP CLI:

```bash
c
```

The output will be an XML document generated from the input FHIR file.

## 🛠 Configuration

This project uses JSON-based mapping files to extract specific fields from FHIR resources.

### Example: `patient_mapping.json`

```json
{
  "name[0].given[0]": "FirstName",
  "name[0].family": "LastName",
  "birthDate": "BirthDate",
  "telecom[0].value": "HomePhone"
}
```

These mappings determine which FHIR paths are turned into which XML fields.

## 🧱 How It Works

- Each resource (e.g. Patient) is mapped by a class implementing `MapperInterface`
- Mappers use a mapping file and `extractValue()` to pull data from the FHIR input
- The `ClaimMapper` acts as a coordinator and assembles the full XML output
- The system supports both single resources and Bundles

## 📦 Requirements

- PHP 8+
- Composer
