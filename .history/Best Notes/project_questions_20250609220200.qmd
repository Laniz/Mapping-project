# 📋 Questions for Project Manager

## 🧾 Data Format & Examples

1. In the Patient example, will multiple patients ever appear in the same JSON file?
   - If yes, can you provide an example of what that looks like (e.g., a FHIR `Bundle`)?

2. Will all JSON inputs follow FHIR structure strictly (including references and extensions)?

3. Do we expect nested references (e.g., `Claim → Coverage → Organization`) to always be resolved in advance, or should we handle them programmatically?
   1. From fhir-claim.json 




4. Do you have a full example JSON for a real claim with all referenced resources included?

## 🛠 Field Mapping & Dynamic Logic

5. Should field mappings be hard-coded per resource, or dynamically generated from the JSON + config files?

6. Are there required fields that must always be present in the XML even if not in the JSON?

7. Are we allowed to use a config-based approach to minimize hard-coding (e.g., JSON path to XML element name)?

8. How should we handle unexpected or extra fields in the FHIR JSON?

## 📂 File Input/Output Handling

9. What is the expected source of the JSON files — will they be uploaded, streamed, or placed in a fixed folder?

10. Should our code support loading from:
    - Local files only?
    - URLs (FHIR API)?
    - Multiple input files at once (e.g., Claim + Patient + Practitioner)?

11. Should the XML be printed, saved to a file, or posted to an endpoint?

## 👨‍💻 Development & Collaboration

12. Can we keep the code in a public GitHub repository?
    - If yes, are there any guidelines on structure, naming, or documentation?

13. Who else should be reviewing the mapping logic or code?

14. What format would you prefer for code reviews or demoing progress?

15. Should we integrate basic testing (e.g., PHPUnit) into the deliverables?

## 📈 Scope and Future Considerations

16. Are we only mapping to CollaborateMD, or do we need to design this to eventually support other RCM partners?

17. Should the system be structured to support bidirectional mapping (XML → FHIR)?

18. Will there be any downstream validation or schemas that we should conform to for the XML output?
